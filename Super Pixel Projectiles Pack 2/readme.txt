Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- The PNG folder contains all the projectile animations separated into their own folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the projectile animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- The spritesheets are provided as an alternate method of loading the images into your game.
  Each line of a spritesheet's metadata file will look like the following example:
	
	image.png = 0 32 16 24

  The format is:

	path = x y w h

  ...Where path is the path to the file (with extension). X and Y represent the upper left corner (in pixels) of the image on the sheet. W and H represent the width and height of the image on the sheet (in pixels).
  So in our example above, we could locate image.png on our spritesheet. Its upper left corner would be (0, 32) and it would have a size of 16x24.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)
